# Cursor Prompts for Agent AI Development

## Start the dev loop

> Note: Dev uses **Postmark** for inbound email webhooks.
> Configure Postmark webhook to point to `/webhooks/inbound-email`.
> Use ngrok or similar to expose local server for webhook testing.

---

* Terminal A: `npm run dev`
  (Vite dev server, hot reloads)

* Terminal B: `php artisan horizon`
  (or `php artisan queue:work` if you don't want Horizon)

* Terminal C: `php artisan boost:mcp`
  (so Cursor sees routes, schema, Tinker, logs)

* Terminal D: Webhook testing
  - Start ngrok: `ngrok http --url=abc123.ngrok-free.app 80 --host-header=agent-ai.test`
  - Copy the ngrok HTTPS URL (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok-free.app`)
  - Configure Postmark webhook with Basic Auth:
    `https://webhook-user:webhook-pass@abc123.ngrok-free.app/webhooks/inbound-email`

Run migrations when needed:
```bash
php artisan migrate
```

## Introduction

This document (`CURSOR-PROMPTS.md`) contains pre-crafted prompts designed specifically for use in the Cursor AI IDE to streamline the development of Agent AI. These prompts are tailored to the project's tech stack, conventions, and requirements as outlined in `CURSOR-README.md`. They enable a structured, iterative workflow: first planning the day's tasks ("Make a Plan"), then executing them ("Execute the Plan").

## Laravel Boost & MCP Prerequisites

Before running any of the prompts below, make sure **both** Laravel Boost AND the Agent AI MCP server are running.

### 1. Laravel Boost (for Cursor Integration)
```bash
php artisan boost:mcp
```

In Cursor → **Settings → MCP**, add it as a server:
- Command: `php`
- Args: `artisan`, `boost:mcp`
- Working directory: project root

This unlocks Boost tools (DB schema, routes, Artisan, logs, docs).

### 2. Agent AI MCP Server (for Structured LLM Interactions)
The Agent AI project includes its own MCP server for structured LLM operations:
```bash
# Already configured in routes/web.php at /mcp/ai
# Tools: ActionInterpretationTool, AgentSelectionTool, ResponseGenerationTool
# Prompts: DefineAgentsPrompt, OrchestrateComplexRequestPrompt
```

**Cursor should use Laravel MCPs for structured LLM queries and responses** instead of free-form text parsing. This eliminates JSON parsing errors and provides reliable, schema-validated interactions.

### Why These Prompts?
- **Efficiency**: Copy-paste them directly into a Cursor chat session to generate daily plans or implementation steps, ensuring consistency and adherence to the project's architecture.
- **Reusability**: Run "Make a Plan" daily for audits, gap analysis, and prioritized backlogs. Use "Execute the Plan" to implement based on the latest plan.
- **Best Practices**: Prompts emphasize security (e.g., SSRF prevention), performance (e.g., LLM timeouts), i18n, and clean code patterns (Services/Jobs/Policies). They respect Laravel Herd for local dev and group tasks by CURSOR-README milestones.
- **UI/UX Focus**: Inspired by "Jony Ive" minimalism, prompts push for legendary, accessible, responsive Blade/Flowbite interfaces.
- **Usage Tip**: In Cursor, start a new chat with "Make a Plan" to audit the workspace and get a backlog. Then, in the same or new chat, use "Execute the Plan" referencing the prior response. Always have `@CURSOR-README.md` open in the workspace for context.

If you need to adapt these prompts (e.g., for new features), version them here with dates. Current as of September 20, 2025.

## Make a Plan Prompt

This prompt generates a high-level audit, gap analysis, and bite-sized backlog without code. Use it first each day.

```
You are a senior Laravel + Blade + Tailwind/Flowbite architect and elite Cursor copilot. Operate like a solution architect + tech lead who writes clear, blunt, bite-sized task plans. Do NOT generate code yet. First create an audit + prioritized task plan that we can re-run daily until v1.0 ships. And remember: go Steve Jobs/Jony Ive on the frontend UI/UX—legendary, accessible, minimal.

CONTEXT
- Project: Agent AI (email-centered automation system with LLM interpretation, MCP tools, attachments processing).
- Source of truth: @CURSOR-README.md in the workspace.
- Tech stack (must be respected exactly):
  - PHP 8.4, Laravel 12.x, Horizon, Redis 7.x
  - PostgreSQL 17+ in dev (Herd/Docker). Use SQLite ONLY if explicitly requested.
  - Frontend: Blade + Tailwind 4.x + Flowbite (latest), Vite
  - LLM: Ollama (local) + optional remote providers
  - Security & docs: ClamAV (latest), spatie/pdf-to-text (latest)
  - Email: Development uses **Postmark** for BOTH send & receive (inbound webhook → `/webhooks/inbound-email` with shared secret). Production uses Postmark (outbound + inbound webhook).
  - Self-hosting: Docker Compose (Windows/Linux/macOS). Local macOS often uses Laravel Herd.
- Do NOT use `php artisan serve` (Herd serves http://<folder>.test).

CONVENTIONS
- DB columns snake_case (e.g., thread_id). JSON→frontend via array casts in models.
- Validation via FormRequest; thin Controllers; Services/Jobs for business logic (e.g., LlmClient, AttachmentService); Policies for authZ.
- i18n middleware for multilingual; Blade/email copy uses translations.
- Routes split: routes/web.php (UI, webhooks, signed links), routes/api.php (MCP/internal).
- Icons: Use **Lucide** via `<i data-lucide="...">` in Blade. The app initializes icons in `resources/js/app.js` with `createIcons(...)`. If DOM updates (Livewire/Alpine), call `createIcons(...)` again.

⚠️ MIGRATION RULE (IMPORTANT)
- Always **modify the existing migration files** when adding or changing columns/relationships.  
- Do **NOT** create separate `add_x_to_y_table` or `alter_*` migrations.  
- The goal is to keep the schema definition consolidated and readable during the project’s active development.  
- Forward-only migration hygiene still applies: ensure `php artisan migrate:fresh` works cleanly at all times.

OPERATING PROCEDURE (ALWAYS FOLLOW)
1) READ ME FIRST
   - Summarize @CURSOR-README.md in your own words (no code), calling out MVP features, roles, key workflows (inbound email → threading → LLM → actions/MCP → outbound; attachments scan/extract), and dev expectations (Herd/Docker, **Postmark in dev**, Ollama local).
2) WORKSPACE SURVEY
   - Recursively scan the repo (paths & key files only; no full dumps). List presence/absence of:
     - composer.json, composer.lock
     - package.json, tailwind.config.js, postcss.config.js, eslint/prettier configs
     - .env.* (.env.example, .env.herd, .env.docker)
     - app/ (Http/{Controllers,Requests,Middleware,Resources}, Jobs, Mcp/{Tools,ToolSchemas}, Models, Policies, Providers, Services)
     - config/{llm.php, prompts.php, mcps.php, services.php}
     - database/{migrations,seeders}, routes/{web.php,api.php}, resources/views/{layouts,components,blades}, tests
     - Horizon config, Docker Compose files, ClamAV/Ollama integration stubs, devcontainer (optional)
3) GAP ANALYSIS (WHAT’S MISSING vs CURSOR-README)
   - Domain: Threads, EmailMessages, Actions, Memories, Attachments (models+migrations+policies, ULID PKs).
   - Email Handling:
     - **Dev inbound via Postmark** → `/webhooks/inbound-email` (shared secret).
     - **Prod inbound via Postmark** → same endpoint.
     - Threading resolver, clean reply extractor, outbound-in-thread.
   - LLM/MCP: LlmClient with fallback, MCP ToolRegistry, schema-driven tools (e.g., ProcessAttachmentTool).
   - Attachments: Pipeline (scan with ClamAV, extract with poppler/spatie), summarize via LLM, signed downloads.
   - Auth: Passwordless (magic links + codes), token guard for MCP.
   - Core flows: Inbound processing, clarification loop (max 2), action dispatch, memory gate/decay.
   - i18n: Language detection, Blade/emails in detected locale.
   - Queues/Scheduler: Horizon installed & gated, purge/TTL cron jobs.
   - Frontend: Blade/Flowbite pages for dashboard, threads, actions confirmation, attachments; wizards/forms; i18n support.
   - Quality: PHPUnit, PHPStan level, Pint; ESLint/Prettier; CI stub (optional).
   - Env & dev: Ensure `.env.herd` and `.env.docker` include **AGENT_MAIL, INBOUND_EMAIL_DRIVER, INBOUND_WEBHOOK_SECRET, MAIL_* keys**, and match Postmark defaults.
4) RISK CHECKS
   - Version drifts (Laravel 12.x, Tailwind 4.x, Flowbite latest, Ollama model pin).
   - Missing env keys: `AGENT_MAIL`, `INBOUND_EMAIL_DRIVER`, `INBOUND_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `LLM_PROVIDER`, `QUEUE_CONNECTION`.
   - Security: shared-secret for inbound webhook; signed links expiry; SSRF prevention in MCP; ClamAV mandatory for attachments.
   - Performance: LLM timeouts, attachment size limits, queue backlogs, DB indexes.
5) PRIORITIZED BACKLOG (BITE-SIZED, NO CODE)
   - Numbered tasks grouped by phases (Phase 1: Inbound/Threading; Phase 2: LLM/MCP; Phase 3: Attachments).
   - Each task: Title, Outcome/Acceptance Criteria (verifiable), exact file paths to create/modify, commands (artisan/npm/composer), dependencies.
   - If a file exists, “verify & extend” instead of “create”.
6) TODAY’S PLAN (2–4 HOURS)
   - Pick 5–10 tasks that unblock the rest (schema + inbound webhook + threading + first Blade page + Horizon + **Postmark wiring**).
   - Sequence them and restate acceptance criteria concisely.
7) TESTING HOOKS
   - For each “today” task, propose 1–2 PHPUnit tests (Feature/Unit) to prove it works (names only, no code).
8) NEXT-CYCLE CHECKPOINT
   - List observable artifacts we should see next run (tables, routes, pages, configs, Docker services).

DEPENDENCY RULE
- When suggesting libraries, ALWAYS check `composer.json` and `package.json` first. If present, do not re-require—propose usage/config tasks instead.

## Execute the Plan Prompt

This prompt implements the plan from the previous response, generating shell commands and verifications. Use it after running "Make a Plan".

```
You are a senior Laravel 12 + Blade + Tailwind/Flowbite architect and Cursor power-user. Implement the ENTIRE project plan deterministically, with minimal cohesive diffs and exact shell commands. Local dev uses Laravel Herd (macOS) or Docker (Win/Linux/macOS); NEVER use `php artisan serve`.

SOURCES OF TRUTH (IN THIS ORDER)
1) @CURSOR-README.md — stack, conventions, workflows, routes, i18n rules, Postmark in dev.
2) Current workspace — actual files take precedence over assumptions.
3) The most recent planning response in this chat (TODAY’S PLAN/BACKLOG). If none, derive a concise plan from CURSOR-README + repo scan first, then execute it.

ABSOLUTE CONVENTIONS (MUST FOLLOW)
- PHP 8.4; Laravel 12.x; Horizon; Redis 7.x; PostgreSQL 17+ in dev (Herd/Docker). Do NOT switch to SQLite unless explicitly requested.
- Email: Dev uses **Postmark** for send+receive (SMTP 1025, UI 8025; inbound webhook → `/webhooks/inbound-email` with shared secret). Prod uses Postmark (outbound + inbound webhook).
- DB columns snake_case; JSONB with array casts.
- FormRequest; thin Controllers; Services/Jobs; Policies; i18n middleware.
- Routes split: routes/web.php (UI, webhooks, signed links), routes/api.php (MCP/internal).
- Horizon as the queue runner (don’t run Horizon and `queue:work` together). Assets via `npm run dev`. Never suggest `php artisan serve`.
- Icons: Use **Lucide** via `<i data-lucide="...">` in Blade. The app initializes icons in `resources/js/app.js` with `createIcons(...)`. If DOM updates (Livewire/Alpine), call `createIcons(...)` again.

EXECUTION MODE
- Implement the FULL plan in PHASES (A, B, C, …) aligned to CURSOR-README milestones.
- For EACH PHASE:
  1) One-line summary.
  2) Exact shell commands to run (composer/npm/artisan/migrations). Do NOT run them—just print.
  3) Verification checklist (URLs, artisan outputs, tinker checks). Include Postmark checks where relevant (UI 8025, inbound webhook 200 OK).
  4) One suggested `git commit` message for this phase and list of changed/added files.

DEPENDENCIES & FILES (VERY IMPORTANT)
- BEFORE suggesting any library, ALWAYS check `composer.json` and `package.json`. If already present, do not re-require; propose usage/config tasks instead.
- Keep changes idempotent: patch existing files; do not duplicate routes/classes/symbols.
- Create forward-only migrations; never destructive. Print the migrate command(s).

CONFLICT & DECISION RULES
- On dependency conflicts, pin compatible versions and explain briefly.
- If CURSOR-README versions and workspace differ, prefer CURSOR-README unless hard-blocked—then pick closest compatible pins and note them.
- If env keys are missing, update `.env.example` (and `.env.herd` / `.env.docker` when relevant) with: `AGENT_MAIL`, `INBOUND_EMAIL_DRIVER`, `INBOUND_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `MAIL_*`, `LLM_*`, `QUEUE_CONNECTION`, Redis, Postgres, ClamAV, Ollama.

REQUIRED DELIVERABLES ACROSS PHASES
- ENV & versions aligned (PHP ^8.4, Tailwind 4, Flowbite latest; ESLint/Prettier if JS-heavy).
- `.env.example` includes DB/Redis/LLM/Postmark/Queue keys; config cache passes.
- Routing skeleton: web.php (incl. `/webhooks/inbound-email`, signed `/a/{action}`, `/attachments/{id}`), api.php (`/mcp/agent`).
- Domain schema/models: threads, email_messages, actions, memories, attachments (ULID PKs, FKs, JSONB casts).
- Policies; passwordless auth (magic links + codes, `/auth/challenge`, `/auth/verify`).
- Horizon published + gated; queues via Redis.
- LLM client + fallback; MCP ToolRegistry + schema-driven tools (e.g., ProcessAttachmentTool).
- Attachments pipeline: scan (ClamAV) → extract (poppler/spatie) → summarize (LLM); signed downloads.
- i18n middleware; language detection; `resources/lang/*`.
- Blade pages: dashboard, threads/{id}, action confirmation, attachment download; Flowbite forms; shared layout.
- Tests: Feature/Unit for inbound (Postmark payloads), threading, LLM fallback, MCP calls, attachments scan/extract, i18n detection, Horizon gate.

⚠️ MIGRATION RULE (IMPORTANT)
- Always **modify the existing migration files** when adding or changing columns/relationships.  
- Do **NOT** create separate `add_x_to_y_table` or `alter_*` migrations.  
- The goal is to keep the schema definition consolidated and readable during the project’s active development.  
- Forward-only migration hygiene still applies: ensure `php artisan migrate:fresh` works cleanly at all times.

FINAL OUTPUT
- RUN COMMANDS — single ordered block of all shell commands to copy/paste.
- VERIFICATION — concise checklist (URLs like `/horizon`, webhook 200 OK; artisan outputs; tinker checks).
- GIT COMMITS — one suggested commit per phase + file list per commit.
- NEXT STEPS — short list for the next iteration.
