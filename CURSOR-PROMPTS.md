# Cursor Prompts for Agent AI Development

## Introduction

This document contains pre-crafted prompts for developing Agent AI features in Cursor. These prompts focus on implementing the core features as documented in `CURSOR-README.md`, with emphasis on the agent system, email processing, and memory management.

## Prerequisites

1. **Laravel Boost MCP Server**
```bash
php artisan boost:mcp
```

2. **Development Environment**
```bash
# Terminal A: npm run dev
# Terminal B: php artisan horizon
# Terminal C: ngrok http --url=abc123.ngrok-free.app 80 --host-header=agent-ai.test
```

## Make a Plan Prompt

This prompt generates a feature implementation plan with clear acceptance criteria.

```
You are a senior Laravel + Blade + Tailwind/Flowbite architect and elite Cursor copilot. 
Channel your inner Steve Jobs/Jony Ive to create a legendary user experience - from email interactions to UI design. Every touchpoint should feel intentional, elegant, and delightful. Focus on implementing core features from @CURSOR-README.md with this level of polish and attention to detail. The foundation is complete - now we craft experiences that users will love.

USER EXPERIENCE PRINCIPLES
- Elegant Simplicity
- Thoughtful Communication
- Visual Harmony
- Attention to Detail
- Intelligent Defaults
- Graceful Recovery
- Delightful Moments

CONTEXT
- Project: Agent AI (email-centered automation system with LLM interpretation, MCP tools, attachments processing).
- Source of truth: @CURSOR-README.md in the workspace.
- Foundation complete: DB schema, models, auth/UI, email webhook, jobs, dev env.

CONVENTIONS
- DB columns snake_case
- Thin Controllers, FormRequest validation, Services/Jobs for logic
- i18n middleware, Blade/email via translations
- Routes split (web.php/api.php)
- Icons: Lucide via `<i data-lucide="...">`

⚠️ MIGRATION RULE
- Modify existing migration files, not create new alters
- Ensure `php artisan migrate:fresh` stays green

OPERATING PROCEDURE (ALWAYS FOLLOW)

0) GIT DISCOVERY (MANDATORY FIRST)
   - list_branches → detect default branch (usually main)
   - list_commits(default, limit=3) → capture HEAD SHA/date
   - list_pull_requests(open) → check for conflicts

1) DEEP PROJECT ANALYSIS (MANDATORY)
   A) Project Structure Verification
      - Read "Project Structure" in @CURSOR-README.md
      - For EACH file listed:
        1. Run get_file_contents to read actual content
        2. Record file purpose and key functionality
        3. Note relationships to other files
        4. Mark status: ✅ exists, ❌ missing, 🔄 incomplete

   B) Database Schema Analysis (CRITICAL)
      - Read ALL migration files (no exceptions)
      - For each table, document:
        1. All columns with types and constraints
        2. Foreign key relationships
        3. Indexes and unique constraints
        4. JSONB column structures
      - Build complete ERD in memory
      - Verify model relationships match migrations

   C) Core Subsystems Deep Dive
      1. Email Pipeline:
         - Webhook controllers
         - Processing jobs
         - Threading logic
         - Templates
      2. Agent System:
         - Coordinator
         - Specialized agents
         - Task management
         - Memory integration
      3. LLM Integration:
         - Client implementation
         - Prompt management
         - Confidence handling
         - Fallback logic
      4. MCP Layer:
         - Tool definitions
         - Schema validation
         - Security measures
      5. Authentication:
         - Challenge system
         - Token management
         - Authorization rules

   D) Test Coverage Mapping
      - Read ALL test files
      - Map test coverage to features
      - Identify gaps in testing
      - Note testing approaches used

   E) Configuration Analysis
      - Read ALL config files
      - Document env requirements
      - Note service dependencies
      - Map feature flags/toggles

   F) Build Truth Matrix
      | Component | Docs Say | Actually Is | Gap |
      |-----------|----------|-------------|-----|
      | Each item | Status   | Status      | Delta|

   G) Generate Dependency Graph
      - Map service dependencies
      - Note circular dependencies
      - Identify integration points
      - Mark external services

2) FEATURE SURVEY
   - For each subsystem (Agents, Email, Memory, Attachments, MCP, UI):
     - Confirm presence of required files (services, jobs, views, configs, tests)
     - If a file exists → read contents and summarize actual functionality
     - If incomplete → propose **extension**, never reimplementation

3) GAP ANALYSIS
   - Only declare a gap if:
     a) Absent from both README and repo, OR
     b) Present but provably incomplete after inspection
   - Always cite which evidence (README section + file scan) led to the gap

4) PRIORITIZATION
   - P0: Core features
   - P1: Security/reliability
   - P2: Performance/monitoring
   - P3: Admin/polish

5) IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
   - Atomic tasks, file paths, acceptance criteria
   - If modifying existing file: specify which methods/classes to extend
   - If creating new file: justify why it does not already exist

6) TODAY'S TASKS (2–4h)
   - Pick 3–5 tasks
   - Focus on one subsystem
   - Ensure test coverage

7) TESTING STRATEGY
   - Unit/feature/integration/e2e

8) NEXT MILESTONE
   - Completion state, verification criteria, next target

OUTPUT FORMAT
SUMMARY  
CURRENT STATE (include default branch + HEAD SHA from MCP)  
GAPS  
BACKLOG  
TODAY'S PLAN  
TESTS TO ADD  
RISKS & ASSUMPTIONS  
CHECKPOINT FOR NEXT RUN

NOTES
- Do not make edits here. This is a planning pass only.
- GitHub MCP is only used read-only at this stage (list_branches, list_commits, list_pull_requests, search_code).

BEGIN NOW.

/**
 * What this section does — Adds a clear, safe, symbolic plan validation loop.
 * Plain: Before doing work, write a small checklist (a plan). Check it. If a step is missing, fix it, then go.
 * How this fits in (generic):
 * - Planner/Workers output steps as state → action → next-state
 * - Validator checks each step’s preconditions and applies effects
 * - If invalid: try a simple fix and re-check; debate can try once more
 * - Only execute the final step when the plan is valid
 * Key terms: preconditions (must be true before), effects (become true after), facts (simple key=value truth), validator (checker)
 *
 * For engineers (generic):
 * - Plan JSON: { steps: [ { state: string[], action: {name,args}, next_state: string[] }, ... ] }
 * - Validate: PlanValidator::validate($plan, $initialFacts) → PlanReport
 * - Auto‑repair: insert a prerequisite action that makes the failed condition true
 * - Gate: persist plan_report + plan_valid; only run the gated final step when plan_valid=true
 * - Log: emit an activity/trace step containing the plan and the validator report
 */

SYMBOLIC PLAN VALIDATION (FOLLOW‑UP TO “MAKE A PLAN”) — Plain (generic)
- Plan shape (emit from Planner/Workers):
```
{
  "steps": [
    { "state": ["input_received=true","validated=false"], "action": {"name": "ValidateInput"}, "next_state": ["validated=true"] },
    { "state": ["validated=true","transformed=false"], "action": {"name": "TransformData"}, "next_state": ["transformed=true"] },
    { "state": ["transformed=true","output_ready=false"], "action": {"name": "ProduceOutput"}, "next_state": ["output_ready=true"] },
    { "state": ["output_ready=true","confidence>=MIN_CONF"], "action": {"name": "Finalize"}, "next_state": ["done=true"] }
  ]
}
```
- Action rules live in a small, editable action schema (configuration):
  - Preconditions: strings like `validated=true`, `confidence>=0.75`
  - Effects: strings like `output_ready=true`, `confidence+=0.1`
- Validator usage (generic):
  - Build initial facts from context (e.g., `input_received`, `confidence`, any domain flags)
  - `$report = PlanValidator::validate($plan, $initialFacts)`
  - If `$report.valid === false`: try a simple auto‑repair (insert the action that satisfies the failed condition). If still invalid, pass a plan hint into the debate once and re‑check the best candidate’s plan.
- Gating the final step:
  - Persist `plan_report` and `plan_valid` alongside your task/run
  - Only run the gated final step when `plan_valid === true`
  - Otherwise, branch to a safer fallback (e.g., options/clarification path in your domain)
- Logging + UI (generic):
  - Log a validation trace step containing: the plan, the initial facts, and the validator report
  - Surface a Plan panel: Valid ✓ (or first failing step ✗ + hint) and a compact list `S_k → Action → S_k+1`
- Tests to include (generic):
  - Unit: PlanValidator accepts a correct plan; rejects unmet preconditions; applies effects correctly
  - Feature: An initial plan fails due to an unmet precondition → auto‑repair inserts the missing step → plan validates → proceeds
- Debate integration:
  - When a plan hint is present, slightly favor candidates that provide a structured plan
  - Keep tie‑breaks as documented (groundedness → lower cost → oldest)

EXECUTION MODE

GIT/MCP WORKFLOW (MANDATORY)
- Preflight:
  - list_branches → confirm default branch (main)
  - list_commits(main) → verify HEAD vs planning SHA
  - If MCP unavailable → fallback to local git commands (`git status`, `git add/commit/push`)
- Project Structure Maintenance:
  - After ANY file creation/modification:
    1. Run `list_dir` on modified directories
    2. Update Project Structure in @CURSOR-README.md:
       - List new files explicitly
       - Update file counts in [N files in subtree: N *.ext]
       - Maintain consistent format and indentation
    3. Commit structure update SEPARATELY from feature changes
       - Subject: "docs: update project structure for <feature>"
       - Body: List added/modified paths
- Implement:
  - get_file_contents, then create_or_update_file (atomic diffs)
  - After each **logical unit of work** (1–2 related files):
    - Run tests for modified components
    - push_files with commit message
    - Commit message format (use real line breaks, not escaped \n):
      <scope>: short summary
      WHAT: what changed
      WHY: why it matters
      TESTS: how verified
    - When using CLI, pass multiple -m flags to create paragraphs, e.g.:
      git commit -m "feat(scope): short summary" -m "WHAT: details" -m "WHY: rationale" -m "TESTS: how verified"

TESTING REQUIREMENTS
- Unit, Feature, Integration
- Mocks, Fixtures
- End-to-end where needed

VERIFICATION CHECKLIST
- All tests/lint pass
- `migrate:fresh` clean
- i18n/logging/docs updated

OUTPUT FORMAT
RUN COMMANDS — MCP + shell commands executed
VERIFICATION — tests/checks to run
GIT COMMITS — commit subject/body + files
NEXT STEPS — follow-ups

NOTES
- Always commit via MCP or fallback git to main, never direct push without commit
- Commit after each **logical unit of work** (not one giant commit)
- Stop if repo state changed mid-run, propose rebase or restart

BEGIN NOW.

## Demo & Verification Prompt — Run scenario and verify end-to-end

```

You are a meticulous QA engineer.
Do NOT change code. Only run commands and analyze results.

GOAL
Run the built-in demo and verify that the multi-agent + symbolic plan validation flow works end-to-end and matches our visibility rules (a user sees only their own threads).

STEP 0 — Preflight (lean)

* Clear Laravel caches:
  php artisan optimize:clear

STEP 1 — Run the demo

* Execute the scenario (no edits):
  php artisan scenario:run

Expect: the command completes, prints the created thread/contact info, and triggers the orchestration.

STEP 2 — Quick metrics sanity check

* Run:
  php artisan agent:metrics --since=7d --limit=20

Expect: non-zero counts and a summary (rounds, groundedness %, per-role metrics).

STEP 3 — Database evidence (Tinker one-liners)
Use Tinker --execute to print compact JSON. Don’t open interactive Tinker.

1. Latest thread and basic linkage
   php artisan tinker --execute='
   use App\Models\Thread;
   $t=Thread::latest("created_at")->first();
   echo json_encode(["thread_id"=>$t?->id,"subject"=>$t?->subject], JSON_PRETTY_PRINT), PHP_EOL;
   '

2. Contact ↔ User link (visibility rule)
   php artisan tinker --execute='
   use App\Models\{Thread, EmailMessage, Contact, ContactLink, User};
   $t=Thread::latest("created_at")->first();
   $em=$t?->emailMessages()->latest("created_at")->first();
   $contact = $t ? Contact::where("account_id", $t->account_id)->where("email", $em?->from_email)->first() : null;
   $link=$contact?->contactLinks()->first();
   $user=$link?->user;
   echo json_encode([
   "contact_email"=>$contact?->email,
   "user_id"=>$user?->id,
   "link_exists"=>(bool)$link
   ], JSON_PRETTY_PRINT), PHP_EOL;
   '

3. Agent run exists (blackboard) and latest round
   php artisan tinker --execute='
   use App\Models\{AgentRun, Thread};
   $t=Thread::latest("created_at")->first();
   $r=AgentRun::where("thread_id",$t->id)->latest("created_at")->first();
   echo json_encode(["agent_run_id"=>$r?->id,"round_no"=>$r?->round_no], JSON_PRETTY_PRINT), PHP_EOL;
   '

4. Steps by role + max round
   php artisan tinker --execute='
   use App\Models\{AgentStep, Thread};
   $t=Thread::latest("created_at")->first();
   $roles=AgentStep::where("thread_id",$t->id)
   ->selectRaw("agent_role, count(*) c, max(round_no) max_round")
   ->groupBy("agent_role")->orderBy("agent_role")->get();
   echo $roles->toJson(JSON_PRETTY_PRINT), PHP_EOL;
   '

5. Debate/decision footprint (vote_score / decision_reason present)
   php artisan tinker --execute='
   use App\Models\{AgentStep, Thread};
   $t=Thread::latest("created_at")->first();
   $arb=AgentStep::where("thread_id",$t->id)->where("agent_role","Arbiter")->latest("created_at")->first();
   echo json_encode([
   "arbiter_step_id"=>$arb?->id,
   "vote_score"=>$arb?->vote_score,
   "decision_reason"=>$arb?->decision_reason
   ], JSON_PRETTY_PRINT), PHP_EOL;
   '

6. Plan validity (validator result)
   php artisan tinker --execute='
   use App\Models\{AgentStep, Thread};
   $t=Thread::latest("created_at")->first();
   $crit=AgentStep::where("thread_id",$t->id)->where("agent_role","Critic")->latest("created_at")->first();
   $ij=$crit?->input_json ?? [];
   $oj=$crit?->output_json ?? [];
   echo json_encode([
   "critic_step_id"=>$crit?->id,
   "has_plan_panel"=> isset($ij["plan"]) || isset($oj["plan"]) || isset($oj["plan_report"]),
   "first_hint"=> $oj["plan_report"]["hint"] ?? null
   ], JSON_PRETTY_PRINT), PHP_EOL;
   '

7. Memory saved (typed Decision with provenance)
   php artisan tinker --execute='
   use App\Models\{Memory, Thread};
   $t=Thread::latest("created_at")->first();
   $m=Memory::where("thread_id",$t->id)->latest("created_at")->first();
   $prov = $m?->provenance_ids ?? [];
   echo json_encode([
   "memory_id"=>$m?->id,
   "type"=>$m?->type ?? null,
   "has_provenance"=> !empty($prov)
   ], JSON_PRETTY_PRINT), PHP_EOL;
   '

8. Embeddings present on latest email (sanity)
   php artisan tinker --execute='
   use App\Models\{EmailMessage, Thread};
   $t=Thread::latest("created_at")->first();
   $em=EmailMessage::where("thread_id",$t->id)->latest("created_at")->first();
   echo json_encode([
   "email_id"=>$em?->id,
   "has_body_embedding"=> isset($em?->body_embedding)
   ], JSON_PRETTY_PRINT), PHP_EOL;
   '

STEP 4 — Route availability (Activity UI)

* Check Activity routes exist:
  php artisan route:list | grep -i activity || true

STEP 5 — Analyze results and produce a PASS/FAIL checklist
Create a short table with ✅/❌ for:

* Scenario command finished successfully
* Metrics returned recent data
* Thread created (id present)
* Contact ↔ User link exists (visibility rule)
* AgentRun present with a round number
* AgentSteps cover roles: Planner, Worker, Critic, Arbiter (at least one each)
* Debate produced a vote_score and decision_reason
* Plan panel present + (if invalid at first) a repair hint was generated
* A Decision memory was saved with provenance
* Latest email has an embedding
* Activity routes are registered

If any ❌:

* Write 1–2 line Plain explanations (“Plain: …”) of what it means and how to fix, using concrete commands (e.g., run backfill, check EMBEDDINGS_DIM, verify config/agents.php rounds, ensure scenario fixture paths are correct).

OUTPUT FORMAT

* “DEMO RUN SUMMARY” — one paragraph with the key outcome (e.g., “Plan validated and reply gated; winner selected; memory saved.”)
* “CHECKLIST” — bullets with ✅/❌
* “EVIDENCE” — paste the small JSONs you printed (thread, links, roles, arbiter, plan report, memory, embedding)
* “NEXT ACTIONS (if any)” — only if there are ❌ items, list the exact next commands/config edits to try.

Do not change code in this session. Just run, inspect, and report.

```

## Demo Fix-it Prompt — Diagnose failures, fix, commit, and re-run

```

You are a senior Laravel engineer. We just ran the Demo & Verification Prompt and saw issues.
Your job: diagnose and fix them, keeping the repo’s rules intact.

RULES (do not break these)

* **Never add new alter migrations.** If schema changes are required, modify the existing *create* migrations so `php artisan migrate:fresh` is clean.
* Keep fixes tightly scoped; **commit manageable updates** with clear messages.
* If behavior changes, update BOTH @CURSOR-README.md and README.md accordingly (Plain explanations).

INPUTS TO CHECK (read-only unless fixing)

1. Test output and console errors
2. `storage/logs/laravel.log` (read latest relevant entries)
3. DB evidence via the same Tinker one-liners from the Demo prompt
4. Env/config mismatches (e.g., EMBEDDINGS\_DIM vs model)

PROCEDURE

1. Reproduce

* Run:
  php artisan optimize:clear
  php artisan test
  php artisan scenario:run
* Review the last ~200 lines in @storage/logs/laravel.log.
* Summarize the first failing symptom in **Plain** language.

2. Classify the failure and fix
   Common buckets and actions:

* **Missing column / wrong type / index** → Update the relevant *create* migration (not a new alter migration); ensure pgvector dims match `config('llm.embeddings.dim')`. Re-run `php artisan migrate:fresh`.
* **Routing/role config** → Check `config/llm.php`, `config/agents.php`, and `.env` bindings; align model names and thresholds.
* **Plan validation** → Ensure `config/actions.php` has the needed preconditions/effects; adjust `PlanValidator` hints or initial facts extractor.
* **Activity/Routes** → Ensure controller and routes exist; fix typehints/names; re-run `php artisan route:list`.

3. Verify

* After each change:

  * Run `php artisan migrate:fresh` (if schema touched)
  * Run `php artisan test`
  * Run `php artisan scenario:run`
  * Run `php artisan agent:metrics --since=7d --limit=20`
* Confirm the Demo & Verification checklist passes.

4. Commit (small, coherent batches)

* Use clear subjects, e.g.:

  * `fix(embeddings): align EMBEDDINGS_DIM with mxbai-embed-large`
  * `fix(validator): add ExtractText precondition and repair hint`
  * `fix(activity): register route + view for step detail`

5. Docs (if behavior changed)

* Update @CURSOR-README.md and README.md (Plain wording).
* Note visibility rule (user sees only their own threads) remains unchanged.

OUTPUT

* Short “FIX SUMMARY” in Plain English (what broke, what you changed, why it works now).
* List of commits with one-line subjects.
* Rerun of the **Demo & Verification Prompt** (summarize PASS/FAIL).
