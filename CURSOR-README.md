# Agent AI – Technical Design Document

## Executive Summary

Agent AI is an email-centered automation system built on Laravel 12. It links incoming emails to threads, interprets free text with a Large Language Model (LLM), and executes actions via signed links or controlled tool calls. Tool calls run through a **custom MCP layer** (Model Context Protocol) that enforces JSON schemas and exposes SSRF-safe tools. The system supports **attachments** (txt, md, csv, pdf, etc.) including virus scanning, extraction, and summarization. Passwordless login, Flowbite/Tailwind UI, and a future-proof data model reduce friction. An LLM is always available; when intent is unclear, the system asks follow-up questions until intent is clear (maximum 2 rounds). Redis/Horizon deliver asynchronous reliability. PostgreSQL guarantees integrity and versioned “memories” with TTL/decay. Postmark handles inbound/outbound email with robust RFC threading. The design is self-hostable with Docker.

## Project Overview

### Business Context

* Target audience: small teams and self-hosters who want email as the UI.
* Value: fewer tools, low learning curve, clear audit trail.
* Compliance: GDPR-first, EU hosting option, data minimization.

### Technical Scope

* Inbound via Postmark webhook (HTTP Basic Auth with shared secret).
* Threading with `Message-ID`, `In-Reply-To`, `References`.
* LLM-first interpretation and follow-up loop with signed links.
* **MCP layer**: custom Laravel component with schema-driven tools.
* Passwordless auth (magic link + code).
* Blade/Flowbite/Tailwind UI with i18n.
* Queues via Redis; Horizon for monitoring.
* Docker Compose for self-hosting.
* **Attachments**: storage, virus scan, extraction, and LLM context.

### Key Stakeholders

* Product Owner: prioritization and action taxonomy.
* Engineering Team: Laravel 12 backend, Blade UI, MCP.
* DevOps: containers, secrets, monitoring, backups.
* Compliance/Legal: DPIA, data processing agreement.
* End Users: email recipients and web confirmers.

### Assumptions

* Postmark is available.
* External LLM provider is configured; local fallback via Ollama.
* SMTP/IMAP inbound is out of scope for MVP.
* One region; multi-region later.

### Coding Conventions & Patterns

**Database Conventions**
- All primary keys: ULID (`HasUlids` trait)
- Column names: snake_case (e.g., `thread_id`, `account_id`)
- Foreign keys: `{table}_id` pattern
- JSON columns: `{name}_json` suffix, stored as JSONB
- Boolean columns: `{action}_at` for timestamps, `{is/has}_feature` for flags

**Code Organization**
- **Controllers**: Thin, only routing and response formatting
- **Services**: Business logic (e.g., `LlmClient`, `AttachmentService`)
- **Jobs**: Asynchronous operations (e.g., `ProcessInboundEmail`)
- **Policies**: Authorization logic (e.g., `ActionPolicy`)
- **Models**: Data access with casts and relationships
- **Requests**: Form validation (`FormRequest` classes)

**Frontend Patterns**
- Blade components for reusable UI elements:
  - `<x-thread-metadata>` - Thread info, metadata, and version history
  - `<x-action-status>` - Action state indicators
- Tailwind utility classes, Flowbite components
- Dark mode support with `dark:` variants
- i18n with `__()` helper and language files
- Form requests for validation, CSRF protection
- Signed links for secure actions (15-60 min expiry)

**Security Patterns**
- Passwordless auth with timed challenges
- HMAC validation for webhooks
- SSRF prevention in MCP tools
- Signed downloads with nonce
- Input sanitization and validation

**Naming Conventions**
- Classes: PascalCase (e.g., `ProcessInboundEmail`)
- Methods: camelCase (e.g., `processInboundEmail()`)
- Variables/Properties: camelCase (e.g., `$cleanReply`)
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
- Routes: kebab-case (e.g., `/webhooks/postmark-inbound`)

## Agent Coordination Flow with Laravel MCP

Agent AI uses an intelligent **Coordinator + Specialized Agents** architecture with confidence-based processing. The system automatically routes requests based on complexity and confidence levels, ensuring optimal handling of each interaction.

### Processing Paths

#### 1. Simple Queries (Fast Path, ≥0.75 confidence)
```
User Email → LLM Analysis (ActionInterpretationTool) → Confidence Check →
  → AgentRegistry (Best Match) → Single Agent Processing → Immediate Response

Example: "What's a good pasta recipe?"
1. LLM interprets as info_request (confidence: 0.92)
2. AgentRegistry matches Chef Mario (keywords: recipe, pasta)
3. Chef Mario generates authentic Italian recipe
4. Single email response with thread continuity
```

#### 2. Complex Queries (Orchestration Path)
```
User Email → Complexity Detection → Multi-Agent Orchestrator →
  → LLM Agent Planning → Task Dependencies → Coordinated Execution →
  → Response Synthesis → Single Unified Response

Example: "Plan an Italian anniversary dinner with wine pairings"
1. Detected as complex (keywords: plan, multiple aspects)
2. MultiAgentOrchestrator creates task plan:
   - Chef Mario: Menu planning
   - Sommelier: Wine pairings
   - Event Planner: Timeline & atmosphere
3. Tasks execute with dependencies
4. Coordinator synthesizes one elegant response
```

#### 3. Medium Confidence (0.50-0.74)
```
User Email → LLM Analysis → Medium Confidence →
  → Clarification Email → User Confirms/Adjusts →
  → Normal Processing Path

Example: "Can you help with the sauce?"
1. LLM uncertain about specific sauce (confidence: 0.65)
2. Sends clarification: "Are you asking about pasta sauce or..."
3. User confirms → Routes to Chef Mario
```

#### 4. Low Confidence (<0.50)
```
User Email → LLM Analysis → Low Confidence →
  → Options Email → User Selects →
  → Normal Processing Path

Example: "It needs more..."
1. LLM cannot determine intent (confidence: 0.35)
2. Sends options: "Did you mean:
   a) Add more ingredients
   b) Increase cooking time
   c) Adjust seasoning"
3. User selects → Clear action proceeds
```

### Complete Email Processing Pipeline

#### Phase 1: Email Ingestion & Analysis
1. **Postmark Webhook** (`POST /webhooks/inbound-email`)
   - Receives inbound email via HTTP Basic Auth
   - Validates HMAC signature
   - Stores encrypted payload in `EmailInboundPayload`

2. **Webhook Processing** (`ProcessWebhookPayload` job)
   - Decrypts and parses email content
   - Extracts headers, subject, body, attachments
   - Creates/updates `EmailMessage` with status `'received'`
   - Dispatches `ProcessInboundEmail` job

3. **Email Parsing** (`ProcessInboundEmail` job)
   - Updates status to `'processing'`
   - Extracts clean reply text (removes quoted content)
   - Resolves email threading (RFC 5322)
   - Processes attachments (scanning, extraction)
   - Calls MCP `ActionInterpretationTool` for structured action interpretation

#### Phase 2: Intelligent Agent Routing

4. **Complexity Detection** (`Coordinator::shouldUseMultiAgentOrchestration()`)
   - Analyzes question for complexity keywords: "plan", "organize", "schedule", "multiple", "research"
   - Checks message length (>100 chars = complex)
   - Routes to appropriate processing path

**Simple Path:**
- Single Agent Selection (`AgentRegistry::findBestAgentForAction()`)
- Agent matching by keywords, expertise, role
- Direct task creation and execution

**Complex Path:**
- Multi-Agent Orchestration (`MultiAgentOrchestrator`)
- MCP `DefineAgentsPrompt` generates structured agent plan and task breakdown
- Coordinator creates tasks with dependency management
- Sequential execution with proper ordering

#### Phase 3: Agent Processing & Response

5. **Task Execution** (`AgentProcessor`)
   - Builds contextual prompts with agent personality
   - Includes thread history, user context, agent expertise
   - Calls MCP `ResponseGenerationTool` with agent context and instructions
   - Handles fallbacks at tool level for processing failures

6. **Response Coordination**
   - Single agent: Direct response generation
   - Multi-agent: Coordinator synthesizes all agent outputs
   - Unified response compilation with proper formatting

7. **Email Dispatch** (`SendActionResponse` job)
   - Generates response email via Postmark
   - Includes thread ID in reply-to header for continuity
   - Updates action status to `'completed'`
   - Comprehensive logging and error handling

### Agent System Architecture

#### Agent Implementation Details
1. **Base Capabilities**
   - Natural language understanding
   - Context-aware responses
   - Memory integration
   - Confidence scoring
   - Error recovery

2. **Specialization System**
   ```php
   // Agent specialization structure
   'capabilities_json' => [
       'expertise' => ['italian_cooking', 'recipes'],
       'keywords' => ['pasta', 'pizza', 'cooking'],
       'personality' => 'passionate, authentic',
       'experience' => '25 years Milan restaurants',
       'languages' => ['en', 'it'],
       'action_types' => ['info_request', 'recipe_create'],
   ]
   ```

3. **Memory Integration**
   - Scope-based recall (conversation, domain, global)
   - TTL/decay for freshness
   - Confidence-based supersession
   - PII filtering

4. **Response Generation**
   - Personality-consistent tone
   - Context-aware formatting
   - Multi-step explanation
   - Fallback mechanisms

#### Coordinator Responsibilities
- **Complexity Assessment**: Automatic detection of multi-step requests
- **Agent Selection**: Intelligent routing to domain experts
- **Task Orchestration**: Dependency management and execution ordering
- **Response Synthesis**: Unified output from multiple agent contributions
- **Quality Assurance**: Validation and error recovery

### API Endpoints & Actions

#### Currently Implemented Endpoints

| Method | Path | Purpose | Status |
|--------|------|---------|--------|
| `POST` | `/webhooks/inbound-email` | Postmark webhook receiver | ✅ Implemented |
| `GET` | `/a/{action}` | Action confirmation page | ✅ Implemented |
| `POST` | `/a/{action}` | Execute confirmed action | ✅ Implemented |
| `POST` | `/api/actions/dispatch` | Internal action dispatching | ✅ Implemented |

#### Action Types & Flows

**info_request** (Most Common)
- User asks question → LLM interprets → Routes to best agent → Agent generates response → Single email reply

**Complex Orchestration**
- User requests planning → Multi-agent detection → LLM agent planning → Coordinator execution → Synthesized response

**Confirmation Flow** (Future)
- Action created → User receives confirmation email → Signed link → Action execution

### Data Flow & State Management

#### Database Entities
- `EmailMessage`: Raw email data, processing status, threading
- `Thread`: Conversation container, context, participants
- `Action`: User intent interpretation, execution status, results
- `Task`: Agent-specific work units, dependencies, results
- `Agent`: Specialized AI assistants, capabilities, personalities
- `Memory`: User preferences, context learning, TTL management

#### Processing States
```
EmailMessage: received → processing → processed
Action: pending → processing → completed/failed
Task: pending → processing → completed/failed
```

#### Error Handling
- LLM failures → Fallback responses with reduced confidence
- Agent processing errors → Graceful degradation to basic responses
- Email delivery failures → Comprehensive logging, retry logic
- Thread continuity → Reply-to headers maintain conversation context

## 🔄 Clarification Loop Implementation

### Confidence Thresholds
- **≥0.75 High Confidence**: Auto-dispatch action immediately
- **0.50–0.74 Medium Confidence**: Send clarification email with Confirm/Cancel buttons
- **<0.50 Low Confidence**: Send options email with 2–4 clickable choices

### Email Templates
- **Clarification Email** (`resources/views/emails/clarification.blade.php`):
  - Shows interpreted action summary
  - Confirm/Cancel buttons with signed URLs (72h expiry)
  - Reply-to includes thread ID for continuity

- **Options Email** (`resources/views/emails/options.blade.php`):
  - Contextual options based on original request
  - Signed links for each option (72h expiry)
  - Fallback reply link for manual clarification

### Signed Link Security
- All links use `URL::signedRoute()` with 72-hour expiry
- CSRF protection not required (public endpoints)
- Action status prevents double-processing
- Expired links show `action.expired` view

### Database Changes
- Actions get new statuses: `awaiting_confirmation`, `awaiting_input`
- `meta_json` tracks: `clarification_sent_at`, `options_sent_at`
- Idempotent job execution prevents duplicate emails

### Jobs & Controllers
- **`SendClarificationEmail`**: Queued job with idempotence checks
- **`SendOptionsEmail`**: Queued job with contextual options
- **`ActionConfirmationController`**: Extended with `cancel` and `chooseOption` methods
- Routes: `/a/{action}/cancel`, `/a/{action}/choose/{key}`

### Testing Coverage
- **Feature Tests**: Medium confidence, low confidence options, expired URLs
- **Idempotence Tests**: Multiple job dispatches don't send duplicate emails
- **Integration Test**: End-to-end flow from email to final response

* Story 4: Memories have TTL/decay; supersede; admin can export/purge; provenance visible.
* Story 5: Horizon visible; logs show provider, model, latency, tokens, confidence, outcome.
* Story 6: Language detected; UI/emails in detected language; EN fallback; `Content-Language` set.
* **Story 7: Attachments ≤ 25MB each (default), safe MIME whitelist, mandatory ClamAV scan, extraction and summary available to the LLM, signed downloads.**

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema

#### PK Strategy and ULID Rationale

* All domain tables: **ULID** as PK (`HasUlids`).
* Framework tables: Laravel defaults (jobs, failed_jobs, etc.).
* **Constraint additions** (delta vs previous version):

  * `threads.starter_message_id` → FK to `email_messages(id)`.
  * `email_attachments(email_message_id)` → FK (already present).
  * `memories` remains polymorphic via `scope/scope_id` (no FK); integrity via service layer.

#### Core Tables, Indexes, and Relations

Add casts where relevant:

```php
// app/Models/Action.php
protected $casts = ['payload_json' => 'array'];

// app/Models/Task.php
protected $casts = ['input_json' => 'array', 'result_json' => 'array'];
```

### Clarification Loop State

Add fields to `actions` via **alter migration**:

```php
// 2025_01_01_012000_alter_actions_add_clarification_state.php
Schema::table('actions', function (Blueprint $t) {
  $t->unsignedTinyInteger('clarification_rounds')->default(0);
  $t->unsignedTinyInteger('clarification_max')->default(2);
  $t->timestampTz('last_clarification_sent_at')->nullable();
});
```

Use these fields to reliably control the follow-up loop.

### MCP Layer (Planned)

**Status**: Not yet implemented. Will provide schema-driven tool calls with SSRF protection.

**Future Implementation:**
- ToolRegistry with explicit bindings
- Custom token guard for `api_tokens` table
- JSON schema validation for tool parameters
- Authorization checks preventing IDOR attacks
- No external fetch - only internal Storage access

### LLM Client & Laravel MCP Framework (Implemented)

**Status**: Fully implemented with Laravel MCP framework for structured, error-resistant LLM interactions.

**Architecture:**
- **Laravel MCP Server** at `/mcp/ai` providing RESTful API for structured operations
- **Schema-driven tools** with JSON validation and error handling
- **Structured prompts** for complex multi-agent orchestration
- **Fallback mechanisms** at tool and prompt levels

**MCP Tools (Structured Operations):**
- **`ActionInterpretationTool`**: Email content → validated action JSON (type, parameters, confidence)
  - Input: `clean_reply`, `thread_summary`, `attachments_excerpt`, `recent_memories`
  - Output: Structured JSON with `action_type`, `parameters`, `confidence`
- **`AgentSelectionTool`**: Context analysis → optimal agent selection
  - Input: `account_id`, `action_data`, `context` (thread, locale, memories)
  - Output: `agent_id`, `agent_name`, `capabilities`, `confidence_score`
- **`ResponseGenerationTool`**: Agent expertise → formatted response
  - Input: `agent_id`, `user_query`, `context` (thread, instructions, locale)
  - Output: `response`, `confidence`, `processing_time`, `model_used`

**MCP Prompts (Complex Orchestration):**
- **`DefineAgentsPrompt`**: Complex requests → agent breakdown with tasks & dependencies
  - Arguments: `conversation_subject`, `conversation_plaintext_content`, `goal`, `available_tools`
  - Returns: JSON with agent definitions, roles, capabilities, and task orchestrations
- **`OrchestrateComplexRequestPrompt`**: Multi-agent coordination → user confirmation flow
  - Arguments: `goal`, `defined_agents`, `conversation_subject`, `conversation_plaintext_content`
  - Returns: Formatted coordination message for user approval

**Error Prevention:**
- **Schema validation** prevents malformed requests/responses
- **Tool-level fallbacks** when LLM calls fail
- **Structured JSON** eliminates text parsing errors
- **Dependency injection** for clean, testable code

**Future Enhancements:**
- Multi-provider support (OpenAI, Anthropic) with automatic failover
- Tool chaining for complex multi-step operations
- MCP resource integration for external data sources
- Enhanced confidence score calibration and fallback logic
- Dynamic token limit adjustment based on model capabilities

### i18n: Language Detection (Planned)

**Status**: Not yet implemented. Will use on-prem language detection library.

**Future Implementation:**
- Language detection on clean reply text
- Supported locales: en_US, nl_NL, fr_FR, de_DE
- Fallback to en_US for unsupported languages
- Language-specific email templates and UI strings

### Attachments Processing (Implemented)

**Status**: Fully implemented end-to-end attachment pipeline with security and async processing.

**Implementation Details:**
- **MIME whitelist**: text/plain, text/markdown, text/csv, application/pdf
- **Size limits**: 25MB per file (configurable), 40MB total per email (configurable)
- **Security**: Mandatory ClamAV scan before any extraction; infected files quarantined
- **Text extraction**: Direct for txt/md/csv; spatie/pdf-to-text for PDFs with timeout guards
- **LLM summarization**: attachment_summarize prompt generates concise gist + 3-6 bullets
- **Async processing**: Scan → Extract → Summarize chain on dedicated 'attachments' queue
- **Signed downloads**: GET /attachments/{id} with 15-60min expiry, nonce validation, infected denial
- **LLM integration**: attachments_excerpt assembled from summaries for action interpretation context

**Environment Variables:**
```env
ATTACH_MAX_SIZE_MB=25
ATTACH_TOTAL_MAX_SIZE_MB=40
CLAMAV_HOST=127.0.0.1
CLAMAV_PORT=3310
```

**Flow Diagram:**
1. Email received → ProcessInboundEmail stores attachments + dispatches ScanAttachment
2. ScanAttachment (queue=attachments) → calls ClamAV → clean: ExtractAttachmentText, infected: stop
3. ExtractAttachmentText → extracts text → SummarizeAttachment
4. SummarizeAttachment → calls LLM → stores summary in summarize_json
5. ProcessInboundEmail::getAttachmentsExcerpt() → assembles context for ActionInterpretationTool

**Security Features:**
- ClamAV mandatory scanning prevents malware processing
- Signed URLs with short expiry prevent unauthorized access
- Nonce validation prevents replay attacks
- MIME whitelist prevents dangerous file types
- Size limits prevent DoS attacks
- Comprehensive logging for audit trails

### API Endpoints

#### Currently Implemented

| Method | Path                       | Auth   | Purpose                 | Status |
| ------ | -------------------------- | ------ | ----------------------- | ------ |
| POST   | /webhooks/postmark-inbound | HMAC   | Receive inbound email   | ✅ Implemented |
| GET    | /api/agent-specializations | Auth   | List specializations    | ✅ Implemented |
| POST   | /api/agent-specializations | Auth   | Create specialization   | ✅ Implemented |
| GET    | /api/agent-specializations/{id} | Auth | Get specialization   | ✅ Implemented |
| PUT    | /api/agent-specializations/{id} | Auth | Update specialization| ✅ Implemented |
| DELETE | /api/agent-specializations/{id} | Auth | Delete specialization| ✅ Implemented |

#### Implemented Endpoints

**Public/External API:**
- `GET /a/{action}` - One-click action confirmations (signed links)
- `GET /login/{token}` - Magic link login verification
- `POST /auth/challenge` - Request passwordless authentication
- `POST /auth/verify` - Verify authentication code
- `GET /attachments/{attachment}` - Signed attachment downloads (clean files only, 15-60min expiry)

**Internal/UI and MCP API:**
- `ANY /mcp/agent` - MCP tool execution endpoint
- `POST /api/actions/dispatch` - UI form action dispatch
- `GET /api/threads/{id}` - Thread detail view

**Error handling**: Standard HTTP status codes with JSON error responses.

### Laravel-Specific Patterns (Current)

**Models**: ULID primary keys with `HasUlids` trait, JSONB casts for flexible data storage.

**Migrations**: PSR-12 compliant, foreign key constraints with cascade deletes, GIN indexes on JSONB fields.

**Jobs**: `ProcessInboundEmail` job with basic structure, ready for LLM integration.

**Routes**: RESTful API design with consistent error handling.

**Future**: Policies, rate limiting, job chaining will be implemented as features are built.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

* LLM: P50 < 30 s; P95 < 10 min; timeout 10 min (async processing).
* Inbound → action ≤ 15 min P95 (with LLM interpretation).
* PDF extraction async; summarization on-demand or after extract job.

### Security

* SPF/DKIM/DMARC; List-Unsubscribe where needed.
* Webhook HTTP Basic Auth (Postmark standard); throttling.
* Signed links: expiry 15–60 min, nonce; no PII in URL; idempotent.
* Passwordless rate limits; timing-safe compares.
* OWASP: input validation, CSRF, XSS sanitization, **SSRF prevention** in MCP tools (no external fetch).
* **ClamAV** scan required; quarantine on detection; admin alert.

### Reliability

* Uptime 99.5%.
* Queue retries: 3 with backoff 5 s, 30 s, 2 min.
* LLM: 1 retry on 5xx/timeout; then local fallback; afterwards options email.
* Backups: daily; encryption at rest; monthly restore test.

### Scalability

* Horizontal worker scaling.
* Postgres pooling, targeted indexes.
* Redis cluster when >50 concurrent active users.
* Extraction jobs on a separate queue (`attachments`) with dedicated workers.

### Rate Limiting

| Context           | Rule                                        |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| /auth/challenge   | 5 per 15 min per identifier; 20/hour per IP |
| /auth/verify      | 10 per 15 min per identifier                |
| Webhook           | 120/min total; burst 30                     |
| Signed link route | 60/min per IP                               |
| LLM calls         | 10/min per thread; 100/hour per account     |
| Signed downloads  | 30/min per IP                               |

### LLM Token Caps & Confidence

* Input: 2000 tokens; thread summary 500; output 300.
* Confidence scale `[0,1]`. Auto ≥ 0.75; confirm 0.50–0.74; < 0.50 options email.
* Provider calibration via `config/llm.php`.

## Development Planning

### Milestones

1. **Phase 1 (1 week)**: Inbound webhook, threading, signed links, passwordless basics, Flowbite skeleton.
2. **Phase 2 (2 weeks)**: LLM interpretation, clarification loop (max 2), confidence thresholds, memory write gate, MCP skeleton.
3. **Phase 3 (1–2 weeks)**: **Attachments** (scan/extract/download), TTL/decay/purge jobs, observability, docs and demo.

### Dependencies

* Postmark account + webhook secret
* Redis and PostgreSQL in Docker
* LLM provider keys and Ollama
* ClamAV daemon; poppler-utils/spatie/pdf-to-text
* Laravel 12 skeleton, Tailwind/Flowbite setup

### Development Tooling — Laravel Boost

For developers using **Cursor** or other MCP-aware editors:

- Install Boost:
```bash
  composer require laravel/boost --dev
  php artisan boost:install
```

* Run MCP server (keep running in a terminal):

```bash
php artisan boost:mcp
```

* In Cursor, add MCP server:

  * **Command:** `php`
  * **Args:** `artisan boost:mcp`
  * **Working directory:** project root

This gives the AI assistant real-time access to:

* `php artisan route:list`, `db:schema`, `tinker` context
* Laravel 12 documentation search
* Logs, config, and schema info

> This replaces hand-crafted MCP stubs; Boost becomes the preferred integration layer for development prompts.

### Risk Matrix

| Risk                       | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation                                            |

## MCP Layer Specification

### Definition and Placement

* **Definition**: internal router that exposes tools, prompts, and resources as JSON schema endpoints.
* **Namespaces**:

  * Schemas: `App\Schemas\*`
  * Tools: `App\Mcp\Tools\*`
  * Tool Schemas: `App\Mcp\ToolSchemas\*`
  * Controller: `App\Http\Controllers\McpController`
  * Provider: `App\Providers\McpServiceProvider`

### Action Whitelist v1

`approve`, `reject`, `revise`, `select_option`, `provide_value`, `schedule_propose_times`, `schedule_confirm`, `unsubscribe`, `info_request`, `stop`

**Parameters per type (core):**

| Action                   | Required Parameters                | Notes                       |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| approve/reject           | `target_id: ulid`, `note?/reason?` | Idempotent                  |
| revise                   | `target_id`, `fields: object`      | Partial update              |
| select_option           | `target_id`, `option: string`      | Validated against whitelist |
| provide_value           | `key: string`, `value: any`        | Type-checked in schema      |

| unsubscribe              | `channel:"marketing"|"all"`        | Compliance required.        |
| info_request            | `topic:string`                     | Sends summary/FAQ           |
| stop                     | `reason?:string`                   | Pauses thread/agent         |

## Memory Policy and Read Logic

### Scopes and Priority

* Priority = conflict winner: `conversation > user > account`
* Ties: highest **decayed confidence**, else most recent

### Decay and Supersede

* TTL:

  * `volatile` 30d (half-life 30d)
  * `seasonal` 120d (half-life 90d)
  * `durable` 730d (half-life 365d)
  * `legal` policy-based
* Decay formula: `confidence(t) = c0 * 0.5^(age_days / half_life_days)`
* Supersede: newer, more certain, or explicitly opposite info creates a new version and links to the previous.

### Weighted Reader

```php
class MemoryReader {
  public function get(string $key, array $ctx): ?Memory {
    return $this->best('conversation', $ctx['thread_id'], $key)
        ?? $this->best('user', $ctx['user_id'], $key)
        ?? $this->best('account', $ctx['account_id'], $key);
  }
  protected function best(string $scope, string $id, string $key): ?Memory {
    $candidates = Memory::where(compact('scope','key'))
      ->where('scope_id',$id)
      ->where(function($q){ $q->whereNull('expires_at')->orWhere('expires_at','>', now()); })
      ->orderByDesc('created_at')
      ->get();
    $pick = null; $best = -1;
    foreach ($candidates as $m) {
      $hl = match($m->ttl_category){ 'volatile'=>30,'seasonal'=>90,'durable'=>365, default=>365 };
      $age = $m->created_at->diffInDays();
      $decayed = $m->confidence * pow(0.5, $age / $hl);
      if ($decayed > $best) { $best = $decayed; $pick = $m; }
    }
    return $pick;
  }
}
```

## Testing Strategy

### Golden Set and Taxonomy

* ≥ 100 examples per action type (whitelist v1)
* Cover multilingual variants, typos, attachment cases (pdf/csv)
* Monthly precision/recall measurement and threshold tuning

### Types of Tests

* Unit: thread resolver, signed links, passwordless, schema validators, **AttachmentService**
* Integration: webhook ingest with fixtures; MCP tool calls; ClamAV stub
* E2E: email → interpretation → action → confirmation in thread → signed download
* Load: 20–50 concurrent inbound mails; P95 < 4 s (without heavy extraction)

## Appendices

## Appendix A — LLM Prompt Specifications

### Action Interpreter (system prompt)

You are a strict JSON generator. Detect exactly one action from the user’s email reply.
Allowed `action_type`:

* `approve`
* `reject`
* `revise`
* `select_option`
* `provide_value`
* `schedule_propose_times`
* `schedule_confirm`
* `unsubscribe`
* `info_request`
* `stop`

Return **JSON only**.
Always include a `"confidence"` score in the range `[0,1]`.
Request clarification **only if strictly necessary**.

### Action Interpreter (output schema, verbal description)

Fields:

* **action_type**: enumeration of allowed values (see list above).
* **parameters**: object containing the structured arguments relevant to the action.
* **scope_hint**: enumeration, possible values are `conversation`, `user`, `account`.
* **confidence**: floating-point value in the range `0.0–1.0`.
* **needs_clarification**: boolean flag indicating whether further user input is required.
* **clarification_prompt**: short string with a clarification question, or `null`.

### Memory Gate (system prompt)

Extract relevant, **non-sensitive** facts as key-value pairs for personalization and recall.

Rules:

* Decide **scope**: `user`, `conversation`, or `account`.
* Decide **ttl_category** (time-to-live classification).
* Assign a **confidence** score in the range `[0,1]`.
* Explicitly **reject sensitive data** (e.g., health, politics, financial details).
* Output must be an **array of items**, JSON only.

## Appendix B — Clean Reply Extraction

* Strip previous quoted content using the **reply-parser**.
* Detect language-specific quotation markers such as:

  * “On … wrote:”
  * “Op … schreef …”
* Remove signatures using heuristics, e.g.:

  * “-- ”
  * “Sent from …” / “Verzonden vanaf …”
* Normalize whitespace and trim leading/trailing spaces.

### Appendix C — MCP Tool Schemas (Extended)

Addition: **ProcessAttachmentTool** I/O as described in MCP Layer section.
Responses always return `{"ok":true,"data":...}` or `{"ok":false,"error":"..."}`.

### Appendix D — Glossary

* **MCP**: Model Context Protocol; custom Laravel layer for schema-driven tools/prompts/resources.
* **TTL**: Time To Live
* **Decay**: Confidence reduction over time using half-life.
* **Confidence**: Certainty score ∈ [0,1].
* **ULID**: Lexicographically sortable unique ID.
* **P50/P95**: 50th/95th percentile latencies.

### Appendix E — Docker Compose (Example)

```yaml
services:
  app:
    build: .
    env_file: .env
    depends_on: [postgres, redis, clamav, ollama]
    volumes: [".:/var/www/html"]
  postgres:
    image: postgres:17
    environment: { POSTGRES_PASSWORD: secret, POSTGRES_DB: agentai }
    volumes: ["pg:/var/lib/postgresql/data"]
  redis:
    image: redis:7
    volumes: ["redis:/data"]
  clamav:
    image: clamav/clamav:latest
  ollama:
    image: ollama/ollama:latest
    volumes: ["ollama:/root/.ollama"]
volumes: { pg: {}, redis: {}, ollama: {} }
```

### Appendix F — Security Checklist (Attachments)

* [ ] Enforce MIME whitelist and size limits
* [ ] Mandatory ClamAV scan before extraction
* [ ] Signed downloads with short expiries and nonce
* [ ] No external fetch in tools (SSRF safe)
* [ ] Retention policy and logs for data access

## Appendix G — Prompt Pack & Usage

### Goals & Principles

* **JSON-only**: every model output must be strict JSON according to schema (validated server-side).
* **Short outputs**: no internal reasoning; optional mini-explanation in a `note` field (≤ 1 sentence).
* **Language**: model writes in `:detected_locale` (e.g., “nl” or “en-GB”).
* **Token caps** (from NFRs): input ≤ 2000, summary ≤ 500, output ≤ 300.
* **Confidence**: scale [0,1]; thresholds: auto ≥ 0.75, clarification 0.50–0.74, options email < 0.50.

### Integration Overview (where & when)

**In `ProcessInboundEmail` job**

1. **(Non-LLM)** Clean Reply Extractor
2. **Language Detect (fallback)** – only if library fails → Prompt `language_detect`
3. **Attachment Extractions** (async, non-LLM/OCR where possible) → once excerpts ready:
4. **Action Interpreter** → Prompt `action_interpret`
5. **Memory Gate** (parallel to 4) → Prompt `memory_extract`
6. Decision logic:

   * `confidence ≥ 0.75` ⇒ Dispatch action
   * `0.50–0.74` ⇒ **Clarification** → Prompt `clarify_question` (+ `clarify_email_draft` for email)
   * `< 0.50` ⇒ **Options Email** → Prompt `options_email_draft`
7. **Persist Memories** after policy filter

**In `SummarizeThreadJob`**

* **Thread Summarizer** → Prompt `thread_summarize` (writes to `threads.context_json`).

**For scheduling/appointments**

* **Poll Generator** (optional) → Prompt `poll_email_draft`.

**For attachments**

* **Attachment Summarizer** → Prompt `attachment_summarize` (works on text excerpt).
* **CSV Analyzer** (optional) → Prompt `csv_schema_detect`.

> **Important:** all prompts run through `App\Services\LlmClient` with timeouts/retries from NFRs. JSON is validated against provided **schemas** in `App\Schemas\...`. MCP tools are **not** directly invoked by the LLM; the LLM only outputs intent/parameters, server-side executes validated MCP calls.

### Config Layout

#### `config/llm.php` (sketch)

```php
return [
    'provider' => env('LLM_PROVIDER', 'openai'), // openai|anthropic|ollama
    'model' => env('LLM_MODEL', 'gpt-4o-mini'),
    'timeout_ms' => 600000, // 10 minutes for async email processing
    'retry' => ['max' => 1, 'on' => [408, 429, 500, 502, 503, 504]],
    'calibration' => [
        'openai' => 1.00,
        'anthropic' => 0.97,
        'ollama' => 0.92,
    ],
    'caps' => [
        'input_tokens' => 2000,
        'summary_tokens' => 500,
        'output_tokens' => 300,
    ],
];
```

### `config/prompts.php`

> All templates are **short**, **normative**, and enforce **exact JSON fields**. Each prompt specifies **where** it is used.

### 1) Action Interpreter (`action_interpret`)

**Where**: `ProcessInboundEmail` after clean reply & (optional) attachment excerpts.
**Goal**: One action from the whitelist + parameters + confidence.
**Temperature**: 0.2

```php
'action_interpret' => [
  'temperature' => 0.2,
  'backstory' => 'You convert a user email reply into exactly one allowed action with parameters. Output JSON only.',
  'template' => <<<TXT
You are a strict JSON generator. Detect exactly ONE action from the whitelist below based on the user's reply and context. 
Return JSON matching the schema. No prose, no explanations.

ALLOWED action_type:
- "approve"
- "reject"
- "revise"
- "select_option"
- "provide_value"
- "schedule_propose_times"
- "schedule_confirm"
- "unsubscribe"
- "info_request"
- "stop"

- reject:        { "reason": (required if present in text, ≤200 chars) }
- revise:        { "changes": [string,...] } // list concrete requested changes
- select_option: { "option_id": string | "label": string } // prefer option_id if visible in thread
- provide_value: { "key": string, "value": string } // e.g. "budget":"under 500 EUR"
- schedule_propose_times: { "duration_min": number, "timezone": string, "window_start": ISO8601?, "window_end": ISO8601?, "constraints": string? }
- schedule_confirm:       { "selected_start": ISO8601, "duration_min": number, "timezone": string }
- unsubscribe:   { "scope": "thread"|"account"|"all" } // thread = this conversation only
- info_request:  { "question": string }
- stop:          { "reason": string? }

SCORING:
- confidence in [0,1]; be conservative.
- If insufficient info: choose the closest action and set needs_clarification true with a short prompt.

INPUT:
- locale: :detected_locale
- thread_summary: :thread_summary
- clean_reply: :clean_reply
- attachments_excerpt: :attachments_excerpt  // may be empty
- recent_memories: :recent_memories          // relevant subset

OUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:
{
  "action_type": "approve|reject|revise|select_option|provide_value|schedule_propose_times|schedule_confirm|unsubscribe|info_request|stop",

### 2) Clarification Question (`clarify_question`)

**Where**: when `0.50 ≤ confidence < 0.75`.
**Goal**: One short, concrete question in the user’s language.
**Temperature**: 0.3

```php
'clarify_question' => [
  'temperature' => 0.3,
  'backstory' => 'You write one concise clarification question matching the user’s language.',
  'template' => <<<TXT

## Server-side JSON Schemas (validation)

Place in `app/Schemas` and bind them in the services. Example: **ActionInterpretationSchema**

```php
// app/Schemas/ActionInterpretationSchema.php
namespace App\Schemas;

final class ActionInterpretationSchema {
    /** Return Laravel validation rules for the model JSON. */
    public static function rules(): array {
        return [
            'action_type' => 'required|string|in:approve,reject,revise,select_option,provide_value,schedule_propose_times,schedule_confirm,unsubscribe,info_request,stop',
            'parameters'  => 'required|array',
            'scope_hint'  => 'nullable|string|in:conversation,user,account',
            'confidence'  => 'required|numeric|min:0|max:1',
            'needs_clarification' => 'required|boolean',
            'clarification_prompt' => 'nullable|string|max:200',
        ];
    }
}
```

> Define similar rule classes for `memory_extract`, `thread_summarize`, `attachment_summarize`, etc.

## Example Usage in Code

```php
// App\Services\PromptRunner.php (sketch)
$result = $llm->json(
    promptKey: 'action_interpret',
    vars: [
        'detected_locale'     => $locale,
        'thread_summary'      => $summary,
        'clean_reply'         => $clean,
        'attachments_excerpt' => $attachmentsExcerpt,  // '' ok
        'recent_memories'     => $memSubset,
    ],
    maxOutputTokens: config('llm.caps.output_tokens')
);

Validator::make($result, \App\Schemas\ActionInterpretationSchema::rules())->validate();
$result['confidence'] *= config("llm.calibration.$provider", 1.0);
```

## Parameter Mapping per Action (unambiguous)

* **approve**: `{reason?}` — optional human-friendly explanation.
* **reject**: `{reason?}` — optional; include only if explicitly present.
* **revise**: `{changes: string[]}` — concrete bullet-style changes (“move to 14:00”, “add CC: x\@y”).
* **select_option**: `{option_id | label}` — prefer `option_id` from thread/context; fallback to `label`.
* **provide_value**: `{key, value}` — free key-value (“budget”, “under 500 EUR”).
* **schedule_propose_times**: `{duration_min, timezone, window_start?, window_end?, constraints?}`.
* **schedule_confirm**: `{selected_start, duration_min, timezone}` — ISO8601 start.
* **unsubscribe**: `{scope}` — `"thread"` (this conversation only), `"account"` (sender/tenant), `"all"` (everything).
* **info_request**: `{question}` — explicit user question.
* **stop**: `{reason?}` — user wants to end the conversation/automation.

## Prompt QA & Evaluation

* **JSON validation**: every call → server-side `Validator`.
* **Latency**: P50 < 30s, P95 < 10min; `timeout_ms=600000` (10min), retry once on 5xx/timeout.
* **Golden set**: ≥100 examples per action; measure precision/recall; tune `temperature` and calibration.
* **A/B testing**: keep `options_email_draft` variants per language short and consistent.

## Notes on i18n & Attachments

* **Language**: library-based detection first; prompt `language_detect` is fallback only.
* **Attachments**: text extraction handled **outside the LLM** (PDF-to-text, CSV parser). Prompt `attachment_summarize` is for **short gists**. For large files → use excerpt (e.g., first 16–32 KB) + link to full text on disk.

## What We Explicitly Do Not Do

* No “manager/agent orchestration” prompts: orchestration is server-side (MCP + dispatcher).
* No chain-of-thought or “think aloud” instructions: we request **final JSON only**.
* No direct tool-calls by the model: the model outputs intent/parameters; the server decides and validates.

## Database Schema (Current Implementation)

### Schema Overview

All domain tables use **ULID primary keys** with `HasUlids` trait. PostgreSQL **JSONB** columns store structured data. Foreign keys use ULID format. GIN indexes optimize JSONB queries.

### Core Tables

| Table | Purpose | Key Fields |
|-------|---------|------------|
| `accounts` | Multi-tenant containers | `name`, `settings_json` |
| `users` | Platform users | `display_name`, `locale`, `timezone`, `status` |
| `user_identities` | Login identities (email/phone/OIDC) | `type`, `identifier`, `verified_at` |
| `memberships` | User-account relationships | `role` |
| `threads` | Email conversation containers | `subject`, `context_json`, `version`, `version_history`, `last_activity_at` |
| `email_messages` | Individual messages | `direction`, `message_id`, `headers_json` |
| `actions` | User/system actions | `type`, `payload_json`, `status` |
| `memories` | Versioned context data | `scope`, `key`, `value_json`, `confidence` |
| `contacts` | Ad-hoc email participants | `email`, `name`, `meta_json` |
| `email_inbound_payloads` | Encrypted webhook storage | `ciphertext`, `signature_verified` |

### Migration Files

```bash
# Run all migrations
php artisan migrate

# Available migrations (29 total):
# Framework: jobs, sessions, cache, notifications, etc.
# Domain: accounts, users, threads, email_messages, actions, memories, etc.
# Security: auth_challenges, api_tokens
# Features: agents, tasks, events, availability_polls, attachments
```

### Key Design Decisions

* **ULID PKs**: Distributed ID generation, lexicographically sortable
* **JSONB fields**: Flexible storage for `*_json` columns (settings, payloads, metadata)
* **Foreign keys**: All FKs use ULID format, cascade on delete where appropriate
* **Indexes**: GIN indexes on JSONB, trigram on `message_id`, standard BTREE on lookups
* **Constraints**: Check constraints on enums, unique constraints on business keys

## Postmark & Webhook Setup

### Postmark Configuration

Agent AI uses **Postmark** for all email handling. Follow these steps to set up email processing:

1. **Create a Postmark account** and verify a sender domain/email for outbound mail.

2. **Get your Inbound Address** from Postmark:
   ```
   <hash>@inbound.postmarkapp.com
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables** in your `.env` file:
   ```env
   MAIL_MAILER=postmark
   POSTMARK_TOKEN=pm_xxx
   POSTMARK_MESSAGE_STREAM_ID=outbound
   AGENT_MAIL=<your-inbound-address>@inbound.postmarkapp.com

   WEBHOOK_USER=postmark
   WEBHOOK_PASS=your-long-random-password
   ```

4. **Expose your local app for webhook testing** using ngrok:
   ```bash
   # For Herd (macOS)
   ngrok http --url=abc123.ngrok-free.app 80 --host-header=agent-ai.test

   # For Docker
   ngrok http --url=abc123.ngrok-free.app 8080
   ```

5. **Configure Postmark webhook** in your inbound stream settings:
   ```
   https://WEBHOOK_USER:WEBHOOK_PASS@abc123.ngrok-free.app/webhooks/inbound-email
   ```

**URLs for testing:**
- **Herd**: https://abc123.ngrok-free.app/webhooks/inbound-email
- **Docker**: https://abc123.ngrok-free.app/webhooks/inbound-email

Send test emails to your `AGENT_MAIL` address to verify webhook processing.

## Configuration Overview

**Environment Variables**: See `.env.example` for complete configuration template.

**Key Configs**:
- `config/database.php` - PostgreSQL with JSONB support
- `config/queue.php` - Redis queues for async processing
- `config/mail.php` - Postmark integration
- `config/filesystems.php` - Local storage with attachments disk

**Future Configs** (not yet implemented):
- `config/llm.php` - Provider settings and token limits
- `config/prompts.php` - LLM prompt templates
- `config/mcps.php` - MCP tool registry

## Testing Strategy (Future)

**Unit Tests**: Models, services, jobs with comprehensive coverage.

**Feature Tests**: Webhook processing, authentication flows, API endpoints.

**Integration Tests**: End-to-end email processing with LLM mocks.

**Golden Set**: ≥100 examples per action type for LLM training and validation.

**CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with PostgreSQL, Redis, automated testing.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### LLM Timeout Errors
```
Error: cURL timeout in LlmClient
```
**Solutions**:
- Check Ollama service: `docker-compose ps | grep ollama`
- Increase timeout in `config/llm.php`: `'timeout_ms' => 8000`
- Switch provider: `LLM_PROVIDER=openai` in `.env`
- Verify model is downloaded: `docker-compose exec ollama ollama list`

#### Attachment Scan Failures
```
ClamAV connection refused
```
**Solutions**:
- Ensure ClamAV container is running: `docker-compose ps | grep clamav`
- Check network connectivity: `docker-compose exec clamav ping postgres`
- Verify clamd is listening: `docker-compose exec clamav netstat -tlnp | grep 3310`
- Check logs: `docker-compose logs clamav`

#### Webhook Signature Verification Failed
```
HMAC verification failed
```
**Solutions**:
- Verify `WEBHOOK_USER` and `WEBHOOK_PASS` in `.env` for HTTP Basic Auth
- Check webhook URL encoding in Postmark (should be your ngrok/localtunnel URL)
- Ensure raw request body is used for HMAC calculation
- Test with Postmark's webhook tester

#### Thread Resolution Issues
```
Multiple threads created for same conversation
```
**Solutions**:
- Check subject normalization in `ThreadResolver`
- Verify RFC headers are parsed correctly (`Message-ID`, `In-Reply-To`, `References`)
- Enable X-Thread-ID header if available in Postmark
- Check database for duplicate threads

#### Memory Decay Not Working
```
Memories not expiring as expected
```
**Solutions**:
- Verify TTL categories in `MemoryReader::best()` method
- Check half-life calculations: `confidence(t) = c0 * 0.5^(age_days / half_life_days)`
- Ensure cron jobs are running: `crontab -l | grep artisan`
- Test decay formula manually in tinker: `php artisan tinker`

#### Queue Backlog Issues
```
Jobs piling up in Redis
```
**Solutions**:
- Start more workers: `php artisan queue:work --max-jobs=1000`
- Scale with multiple processes: `for i in {1..3}; do php artisan queue:work & done`
- Use dedicated queues: `php artisan queue:work --queue=attachments`
- Monitor via Horizon dashboard

#### Database Connection Issues
```
SQLSTATE[08006] [7] connection to server at "localhost" (127.0.0.1), port 5432 failed
```
**Solutions**:
- Ensure PostgreSQL is running: `docker-compose ps postgres`
- Check credentials in `.env`
- Verify database exists: `docker-compose exec postgres psql -U agent_user -l`
- Check connection from app: `php artisan tinker` then `DB::connection()->getPdo()`

#### Localization Not Working
```
Translation strings not showing in correct language
```
**Solutions**:
- Check `APP_LOCALE` in `.env` (use `en_US` or `nl_NL`)
- Ensure language files exist: `ls resources/lang/`
- Clear cache: `php artisan optimize:clear`
- Test in blade: `{{ __('messages.welcome') }}`

#### File Upload Issues
```
Unable to write file to attachments disk
```
**Solutions**:
- Check storage permissions: `chmod -R 755 storage/`
- Verify disk configuration in `config/filesystems.php`
- Ensure directory exists: `mkdir -p storage/app/attachments`
- Check available disk space: `df -h`

### Performance Issues

#### Slow LLM Responses (>4 seconds)
- Switch to external provider (OpenAI/Anthropic)
- Reduce input token limits in `config/llm.php`
- Implement caching for common prompts
- Use smaller models in Ollama

#### High Memory Usage
- Process attachments in chunks
- Clear temporary files after processing
- Monitor with `memory_get_peak_usage(true)`
- Use queue jobs for heavy processing

### Testing Issues

#### Feature Tests Failing
- Ensure database is seeded: `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed`
- Check test database configuration
- Use `RefreshDatabase` trait in tests
- Mock external services (LLM, ClamAV)

### Backup Strategy

```bash
# Database backup script
#!/bin/bash
DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
docker-compose exec postgres pg_dump -U agent_user agent_ai_prod > backup_$DATE.sql

# File backup
tar -czf attachments_$DATE.tar.gz storage/app/attachments/

# Upload to S3 (example)
aws s3 cp backup_$DATE.sql s3://your-backup-bucket/
aws s3 cp attachments_$DATE.tar.gz s3://your-backup-bucket/
```
